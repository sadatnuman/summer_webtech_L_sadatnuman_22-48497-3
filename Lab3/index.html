        Traffic jam in Dhaka city is one of the most serious problems. Every day, thousands of vehicles block the roads and cause long delays. People lose their valuable time stuck in traffic. The reasons behind traffic congestion include unplanned roads, too many vehicles, poor traffic management, and lack of public awareness. Students miss classes, workers get late, and patients suffer. It also increases fuel consumption and air pollution. To solve this problem, proper planning, better public transport, and traffic rules should be strictly followed.
